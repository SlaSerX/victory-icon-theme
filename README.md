# Victory Icon Theme

Victory Icon Theme: A Gtk Icon Theme for Linux. Currently in testing, it's fairly complete but there may be icons missing every now and then. Created primarly for XFCE, but should work okay on Gnome, LXQT/LXDE, Budgie, Mint, etc. If anyone finds missing icons on any of the latter Desktop Environments, please let me know.
